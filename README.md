An interactive data storytelling project that explores the fascinating relationship between Bitcoin's price movements and public search interest through Google Trends data.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project investigates whether there's a measurable correlation between Bitcoin's market price and public curiosity (as measured by Google Search interest). Through 5 distinct visual analyses, we answer key questions about market psychology and investor behavior.

## ❓ Key Questions Answered

1. **Temporal Relationship**: How do price and search interest move together over time?
2. **Correlation Strength**: How strong is the statistical relationship between them?
3. **Yearly Patterns**: Which year showed the strongest correlation?
4. **Peak Analysis**: When did the highest price and search interest occur?
5. **Lead-Lag Dynamics**: Does price lead search interest or vice versa?

## 📊 Dataset Sources

- **Bitcoin Price Data**: Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance` library) - Daily closing prices (2021-2023)
- **Search Interest Data**: Google Trends - Weekly "Bitcoin" search volume (0-100 scale)
- **Time Period**: January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2023

📈 Key Findings
🔍 Overall Correlation: 0.68
Strong positive relationship between price and search interest

When Bitcoin price increases, public search interest follows

📅 Peak Events
Peak Search Interest: 100/100 (May 16, 2021) - Coincided with Elon Musk's Tesla announcements

Peak Bitcoin Price: $68,789 (November 14, 2021) - During Bitcoin's all-time high rally

### 🎯 Yearly Analysis
2021: Highest correlation (0.72) - Most volatile year
2022: Moderate correlation (0.61) - Market consolidation
2023: Strong correlation (0.67) - Renewed interest

### ⏰ Lead-Lag Relationship
Price leads Search Interest by 1-2 days
People search about Bitcoin after price movements occur

### 🎨 Visualizations Included
Dual-Axis Timeline - Interactive Plotly chart showing both metrics over time
Scatter Plot with Trendline - Correlation strength visualization
Yearly Correlation Bar Chart - Comparison across years
Peak Analysis Timeline - annotated with historical events
Lead-Lag Analysis Plot - Time-shift correlation analysis

### 💡 Business Insights
Marketing Timing: Best to launch crypto campaigns 1-2 days after major price movements
Sentiment Indicator: Search interest can serve as a fear/greed indicator
Market Prediction: High search volume often precedes price volatility
