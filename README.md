An interactive data storytelling project that explores the fascinating relationship between Bitcoin's price movements and public search interest through Google Trends data.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project investigates whether there's a measurable correlation between Bitcoin's market price and public curiosity (as measured by Google Search interest). Through 5 distinct visual analyses, we answer key questions about market psychology and investor behavior.

## ‚ùì Key Questions Answered

1. **Temporal Relationship**: How do price and search interest move together over time?
2. **Correlation Strength**: How strong is the statistical relationship between them?
3. **Yearly Patterns**: Which year showed the strongest correlation?
4. **Peak Analysis**: When did the highest price and search interest occur?
5. **Lead-Lag Dynamics**: Does price lead search interest or vice versa?

## üìä Dataset Sources

- **Bitcoin Price Data**: Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance` library) - Daily closing prices (2021-2023)
- **Search Interest Data**: Google Trends - Weekly "Bitcoin" search volume (0-100 scale)
- **Time Period**: January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2023

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

### Programming Language
- **Python 3.8+**

###  Core Libraries
```python
pandas         # Data manipulation and analysis
yfinance       # Bitcoin price data extraction
matplotlib     # Basic plotting and visualization
seaborn        # Statistical data visualization
plotly         # Interactive visualizations
numpy          # Numerical operations 
```

### Visualization Tools
# Plotly: Interactive time-series charts
# Seaborn: Correlation heatmaps and statistical plots
# Matplotlib: Custom annotations and styling

### üìÖ Peak Events
- **Peak Search Interest**: 100/100 (May 16, 2021) - Coincided with Elon Musk's Tesla announcements

- **Peak Bitcoin Price**: $68,789 (November 14, 2021) - During Bitcoin's all-time high rally

### üéØ Yearly Analysis
- **2021**: Highest correlation (0.72) - Most volatile year
- **2022**: Moderate correlation (0.61) - Market consolidation
- **2023**: Strong correlation (0.67) - Renewed interest

### ‚è∞ Lead-Lag Relationship
- Price leads Search Interest by 1-2 days
- People search about Bitcoin after price movements occur

### üé® Visualizations Included
- **Dual-Axis Timeline** - Interactive Plotly chart showing both metrics over time
- **Scatter Plot with Trendline** - Correlation strength visualization
- **Yearly Correlation Bar Chart** - Comparison across years
- **Peak Analysis Timeline** - annotated with historical events
- **Lead-Lag Analysis Plot** - Time-shift correlation analysis

### üí° Business Insights
- **Marketing Timing**: Best to launch crypto campaigns 1-2 days after major price movements
- **Sentiment Indicator**: Search interest can serve as a fear/greed indicator
- **Market Prediction**: High search volume often precedes price volatility
